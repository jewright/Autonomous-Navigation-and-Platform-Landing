# Autonomous Navigation with a Jackal UGV

To advance autonomous navigation and landing, I applied ROS onto a Jackal UGV with robotic accessories, a UAV, and Vicon Motion Capture System.

## Vicon Motion Capture System
Vicon, which is a motion capture system, was utilized in the beginning to learn the position and location of the UGV in a specified environment within the lab. The Vicon system required camera calibration and object identification to work alongside the Jackal UGV. For interaction between the two, Wi-Fi is used for Vicon to launch through the onboard computer within the Jackal UGV. This interaction allows the data from the Jackal UGV to be obtained and recorded. For behavioral control of the UGV, Python, and ROS are used for programming implementations. I wrote many scripts for directional movements and routes, such as a linear and square. I created a personalized map of the lab environment used for this project. 

The Jackal UGV was used as the platform landing for the UAV.
